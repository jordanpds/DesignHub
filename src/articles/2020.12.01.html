Hey everyone,<br><br>Out with the old Launcher in with DesignHub, this new program provides several different shortcuts for each application we currently use. Most applications are implemented into DesignHub, any that are not installed on your computer will be greyed out and unselectable. There are a few options under applications that you can choose from; OEM Apps, Native Apps, and Maintenance. <br><br>OEM Apps provides a quick way to launch versions of software that use specific settings, whether it's Ford, GM, Toyota, or Daimler, it will launch the shortcuts to each application. <br><br>Native Apps are the base form of the app with no OEM settings, so if specific versions of programs are needed but they are separate from the OEM Settings, whether it's NX or Catia. There is also another tab called Other Apps, these are apps that are not commonly used but are occasionally installed on a pc if needed. <br><br>The Maintenance tab focuses on cleaning up temporary files established by the applications, once maintenance is run it will take some time but it will clean up the temporary files. Currently the only maintenance provided is either Ford Teamcenter and CATIA Settings, once run it will remove all the settings for each program, please be warned that any licenses borrowed when running CATIA Settings Clean it will lock the license, so please return them before running.<br><br>The purpose of DesignHub is quite simple, consolidate all shortcuts on every machine into one application launcher. The amount of shortcuts on the desktop gets a bit overwhelming when you want to include several different versions of these applications, CATIA R27, Theorem CATIA R27, CATIA R29, Theorem CATIA R29, etc. It can make it difficult to keep track and accidentally launching the wrong application could cause problems. <br><br>With DesignHub neatly sorting each application into their specific categories, it allows an easier way of navigating and selecting the correct programs. There is more planned for DesignHub in the future, a way to update to the latest CATIA Environment files, a Knowledge Base of common solutions for problems that seem to occur often as well as just general info. Although these would take time and be released in future versions as of right now it's just a base application launcher and maintenance program.<br><br>There is much more work to be done with DesignHub and there are several ideas floating around on other ideas to implement into it. If you do have an idea that you'd think would benefit DesignHub or you're encountering a problem you can contact me with the information, please specify in the subject "DesignHub Feedback".
